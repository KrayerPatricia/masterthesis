*        The term ""pulses"" is limited to crops harvested solely for dry grain, thereby excluding crops harvested green for food (green peas, green beans, etc.) which are classified as vegetable crops.
*        Also excluded are those crops used mainly for oil extraction (e.g. soybean and groundnuts) and leguminous crops (e.g. seeds of clover and alfalfa) that are used exclusively for sowing purposes.
*        In addition to their food value, pulses also play an important role in cropping systems because of their ability to produce nitrogen and thereby enrich the soil.
*        Pulses contain carbohydrates, mainly starches (55-65 percent of the total weight); proteins, including essential amino acids (18-25 percent, and much higher than cereals) and fat (1 - 4 percent).
*        The remainder consists of water and inedible substances.

*        It does include starch and the starchy pith and flour obtained from the trunk of the sago palm and the stem of the Abyssinian banana (Musa ensete).
*        Apart from their high water content (70-80 percent), these crops contain mainly carbohydrates (largely starches that account for 16-24 percent of their total weight)
*        with very little protein and fat (0-2 percent each).
*        Production data of root crops should be reported in terms of clean weight, i.e. free of earth and mud.
836."Rubber, natural"

*        FAO includes in this group only dessert or table nuts. Nuts that are used mainly for flavouring beverages and masticatory and stimulant nuts should be excluded.
*        An exception is made for areca nuts and kola nuts, which FAO considers to be inedible nuts, but which are included with the nut and derived products group to be consistent with international trade classifications.
*        Nuts used mainly for the extraction of oil or butter, (e.g. sheanuts) as well as nuts contained in other fruits (e.g. peaches) are excluded.
*        It should be noted that some countries report certain nut crops (chestnuts, pignolia nuts) with forestry products.
*        Production data relate to the weight of nuts in the shell or husk, but without the outer husk.

*        Vegetables grown principally for animal feed or seed should be excluded.
*        Certain plants, normally classified as cereals and pulses, belong to this group when harvested green, such as green maize, green peas, etc.
*        This grouping differs from international trade classifications for vegetables in that it includes melons and watermelons, which are normally considered to be fruit crops.
*        But, whereas fruit crops are virtually all permanent crops, melons and watermelons are similar to vegetables in that they are temporary crops.
*        Chillies and green peppers are included in this grouping when they are harvested for consumption as vegetables and not processed into spices.
*        FAO production data for green peas and green beans refer to the total weight including pods, although some countries report on a shelled weight basis.
*        The weight of the pods ranges from 40 to 50 percent for peas to up to 70 percent for broad beans.
*        Area data on small vegetable gardens are often omitted in agricultural surveys, although production estimates may be reported.
*        Vegetables contain principally water, accounting for between 70 percent and 95 percent of their weight. They are low in nutrients, but contain minerals and vitamins.

*1.2) Animal production

*1.2a) Livestock primary

*GENERALITIES on animal data in FAOSTAT:
*Figures on livestock numbers should refer to live animals enumerated on a given day or on several consecutive days.
*The FAO practice is that figures for an indicated year relate to animals reported by countries for any day between October of the previous year and September of the year indicated.
*For each animal species FAO proposes that information be maintained on changes in national herds during the year according to the following equation:
*        initial herd + animals born + imports of live animals - exports of live animals - natural losses - slaughter = closing herd.
*FAO defines meat as the flesh of animals used for food.
*In production data, meat is normally reported inclusive of bone and exclusive of meat that is unfit for human consumption.
*As reported by individual countries, meat production data may refer either to
*        commercial production (meat entering marketing channels),
*        inspected production (from animals slaughtered under sanitary inspection),
*        or total production (the total of the above- mentioned categories plus slaughter for personal consumption).
*All FAO annual production data refer to total production.
*Country statistics on meat production adhere to one or more of the following concepts:
*        1. Live weight: the weight of the animal immediately before slaughter.
*        2. Killed weight: the live weight less the uncollected blood lost during slaughter.
*        3. Dressed carcass weight: weight minus all parts - edible and inedible - that are removed in dressing the carcass.
*                The concept varies widely from country to country and according to the various species of livestock.
*          - Edible parts generally include edible offals (head or head meat, tongue, brains, heart, liver, spleen, stomach or tripes and, in a few countries, other parts such as feet, throat and lungs.
*          - Slaughter fats (the unrendered fats that fall in the course of dressing the carcasses) are recorded as either edible or inedible according to country practice.
*          - Inedible parts generally include hides and skins (except in the case of pigs), as well as hoofs and stomach contents.
*        Meat production data for minor animals (poultry, rabbits, etc.) are reported in one of the following three ways:
*                -ready-to-cook weight (giblets are sometimes included and sometimes excluded,
*                -eviscerated weight (including the feet and head)) or
*                -dressed weight, i.e. the live weight less the blood, feathers and skin.
*FAO data relate to dressed carcass weight for livestock and, wherever possible, ready-to-cook weight for poultry.
*Among individual countries, one of the following three concepts issued to measure production:
*        A. Production from all animals, of both indigenous and foreign origin, that are slaughtered within national boundaries.
*        B. Production from the slaughter of indigenous animals plus exports of live indigenous animals during the reference period.
*                Derived from meat production as follows: production from slaughtered animals plus the meat equivalent of all animals exported alive, minus the meat equivalent of all animals imported alive.
*                As imports/exports of live animals are recorded by FAO in numbers, not weight, animal type and size are of significance.
*        C. The biological production concept covers indigenous animals that are either slaughtered or exported live, plus net additions to the stock during the reference period.
*                Derived from indigenous productions follows: indigenous production plus (or minus) the meat equivalent of the change in the stock numbers during the reference period.
*Production is expressed in terms of live weight. Changes in the total live weight of all animals are not taken into account.
*FAO uses the first concept of meat production in the construction of its food balance sheets and for related indicators.
*        The second concept, indigenous meat production, in measuring the output of the national livestock sector, is useful mainly in the construction of index numbers of agricultural production.
*        The third concept, biological production, would be the most complete as it also reflects changes in the livestock herd, but it is not used because of difficulties in obtaining information from national reporting offices.
*The prices applied to indigenous meat production are derived from prices of live animals.
*        This covers not only the value of meat, but also the value of offals, fats, hides and skins.
*
*"Milk, eggs, honey and beeswax are included as products of live animals.
*        Fibres of animal origin (mainly wool and silk) are included with fibres of vegetal and animal origin.
*Milk and dairy products. Estimates of milk production as reported by countries refer to one or more of the following three concepts.
*        Gross production is milk production plus milk sucked by young animals.
*        Production available for consumption is net production less milk fed to animals, milk retained by farmers for food and feed, direct sales to consumers and farm waste.
*The FAO concept relates to net milk production.
*        Data should be reported by kind of milking animal (cow, sheep, goat, etc.) in terms of whole milk and by weight.
*In most developed countries only 5-10 percent of whole milk is used directly for human consumption.
*        The bulk of milk production is processed before being marketed as liquid milk (e. G. standardized, pasteurized, skimmed, etc.)
*        or is manufactured in to products such as cream, butter, cheese, evaporated and condensed milk, milk powder, casein, yogurt, ice cream, etc.
*About 70 percent of whole milk is processed into dairy products
*        the by-products of these processes (e. G. skim milk, buttermilk and whey) are used either for feed or are manufactured into other dairy products, e. G. dry skim milk and low-fat cheese.
*Processed milk and dairy products are often supplemented with vitamins, mineral and various additives.
*FAO list 50 milk and dairy product items in the list that follows, of which five are primary products.
*Some food products containing milk are not listed separately by FAO, e. G. eggnog, sherbet, malted milk, chocolate milk drink and mellorine."

1904."Animal fats"
1976."Animal Oil+Fat+Grs"
1903."Animal Vegetable Oil"
*        "Vegetables oils and fats. Oil extraction by traditional methods often requires various preliminary operations, such as cracking, shelling, dehulling, etc., after which the crop is ground to a paste.
*        The paste, or the whole fruit, is then boiled with water and stirred until the oil separates and can be collected.
*        Such traditional methods have a low rate of efficiency, particularly when performed manually.
*        Oil extracted by pressing without heating is the purest method and often produces an edible product without refining.
*        Modern methods of oil recovery include crushing and pressing, as well as dissolving the crop in a solvent, most commonly hexane.
*        Extracting oil with a solvent is a more efficient method than pressing. The residue left after the removal of oil (oilcake or meal) is used as feedstuff.
*        Crude vegetable oils are obtained without further processing other than degumming or filtering.
*        To make them suitable for human consumption, most edible vegetable oils are refined to remove impurities and toxic substances, a process which involves bleaching,
*        deodorization and cooling (to make the oils stable in cold temperatures). The loss involved in these processes ranges from 4 to 8 percent.
*        The FAO concept includes raw, refined and fractioned oils, but not chemically modified oils. With some exceptions, and in contrast to animal fats,
*        vegetable oils contain predominantly unsaturated (light, liquid) fatty acids of two kinds: monounsaturated (oleic acid - mainly in extra virgin olive oil)
*        and polyunsaturated (linoleic acid and linolenic acid - in oils extracted from oilseeds). Vegetable oils have a wide variety of food uses, including salad and cooking oils,
*        as well as in the production of margarine, shortening and compound fat. They also enter into many processed products, such as mayonnaise, mustard, potato chips, French fries, salad dressing,
*        sandwich spread and canned fish. Industrial and non-food uses of vegetable oils include the production of soaps, detergents, fatty acids, paint, varnish, resin, plastic and lubricants.
*        Animal oils and fats. This chapter includes animal fats that are obtained in the course of dressing the carcasses of slaughtered animals (slaughter fats),
*        or at a later stage in the butchering process when meat is being prepared for final consumption (butcher fats). Processed animal fats include lard obtained by melting raw pig fat and tallow
*        obtained from raw fat of other animal species. Animal fats are largely used in the production of margarine, shortening and compound fat.
*        They also enter into many processed food products. Industrial and non-food uses of animal fats include the production of soaps, fatty acids, lubricants and feedstuffs."

*        Mineral water and aerated water, even when artificially produced, are also included here. The second group includes water to which sweeteners and flavourings have been added.
*        This group of beverages has been gaining large markets in recent years and represents an important contribution to food consumption in some areas because of the sweetener content (up to 20 percent by weight)
*        of these beverages. The third group includes the most traditional alcoholic beverages consumed by humans. Typically, the alcohol content of these beverages,
*        which is obtained through fermentation of many vegetable crops, varies between 3 and 25 percent. The fourth group refers to undenatured ethyl alcohol with alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80 percent,
*        and usually between 40 and 50 percent. This category includes all the distilled alcoholic beverages, whether or not sweeteners and/or flavourings have been added.
*        The fifth and final group includes products that are not for human consumption, but are included here because they are closely related to alcoholic beverages.

2077."Total Meat"
*        "FAO defines meat as the flesh of animals used for food. In production data, meat is normally reported inclusive of bone and exclusive of meat that is unfit for human consumption.
*        As reported by individual countries, meat production data may refer either to commercial production (meat entering marketing channels), inspected production (from animals slaughtered under sanitary inspection),
*        or total production (the total of the above- mentioned categories plus slaughter for personal consumption). All FAO annual production data refer to total production.
*        Country statistics on meat production adhere to one or more of the following concepts: 1. Live weight: the weight of the animal immediately before slaughter. 2. Killed weight:
*        the live weight less the uncollected blood lost during slaughter. 3. Dressed carcass weight: weight minus all parts - edible and inedible - that are removed in dressing the carcass.
*        The concept varies widely from country to country and according to the various species of livestock.
*        Edible parts generally include edible offals (head or head meat, tongue, brains, heart, liver, spleen, stomach or tripes and, in a few countries, other parts such as feet, throat and lungs.
*        Slaughter fats (the unrendered fats that fall in the course of dressing the carcasses) are recorded as either edible or inedible according to country practice.
*        Inedible parts generally include hides and skins (except in the case of pigs), as well as hoofs and stomach contents.
*        Meat production data for minor animals (poultry, rabbits, etc.) are reported in one of the following three ways: ready-to-cook weight (giblets are sometimes included and sometimes excluded)
10."Total Merchandise Trade"
*        "According to the International Merchandise Trade Statistics Compilers Manual, by UNSD, it is recommended that international merchandise trade statistics record all goods
*        which add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory.
*        Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) or temporarily admitted or withdrawn (except for goods for inward or outward processing)
